# VaiaOneBitPlus
A polyphonic 1-bit synth, made with the iPlug2 framework

## Features
Play as many notes at the same time as you dare (with a low pulse width, you can pick out quite a few notes in a chord)
Choose one of (currently) 4 instrument settings, based on the velocity (high velo: top instrument, low velo: bottom instrument)
Mod wheel and Pitch wheel support
Automate everything!

3 noise types on the bottom 3 MIDI notes
-> less velocity means fewer noise "spikes", reducing perceived volume
